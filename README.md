# Gridy One-Time Graphical Cube Authentication

One-Time Graphical Cube Authentication utilises a graphical cube interface where a user can create and input unique patterns by selecting cells in a specific sequence onto one of the six coloured grid-based cube faces. The pattern can be input through touch gestures, such as swiping or tapping, on a touchscreen device. The method captures the sequence of cell selections and compares it to a securely stored pattern for authentication. The method enhances security by leveraging the userâ€™s spatial memory, visual colour memory and unique interaction style, making it more challenging for unauthorized users to replicate the pattern.
